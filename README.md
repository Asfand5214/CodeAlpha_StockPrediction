# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This repository contains code for building and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. This project explores the use of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Yahoo Finance API and consists of historical stock price data for a specific company (e.g., AAPL for Apple). The dataset includes features such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- yfinance

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas yfinance
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction-lstm.git
cd stock-price-prediction-lstm
```

2. Run the `stock_price_prediction_lstm.py` script:

```bash
python stock_price_prediction_lstm.py
```

3. The script will download the historical stock price data, preprocess the data, build an LSTM model, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Results

The script generates plots showing the actual stock prices, predicted stock prices on both training and testing sets, and evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R^2.
