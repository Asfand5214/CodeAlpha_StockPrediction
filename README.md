# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. This project explores the use of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- yfinance

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas yfinance
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the Jupyter Notebook file `Stock_Prediction.ipynb` from this repository.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially. The notebook contains code for downloading the historical stock price data, preprocessing the data, building an LSTM model, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Results

The notebook generates plots showing the actual stock prices, predicted stock prices on both training and testing sets, and evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R^2.
